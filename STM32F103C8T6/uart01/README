This is derived from blinker02.

There are a number of steps involved in initializing the uart.  The
USART1 I/O is PA9 and PA10.  So GPIOA needs to be enabled.  Because
this example blinks the led for a bit GPIOC needs to be enabled.  And
USART1 has to be enabled.  Now that GPIOA is enabled we can tell GPIOA
that PA9 is going to use the alternate function output, USART1_TX.  For
alternate function inputs the manual says to set them as normal inputs
so we do that as well.  Now we initialize the uart following the
procedure in the manual.

We have not messed with the system clock so based on blinker02 we are
running at 8MHz we assume. So some math:

    //8000000/16 = 500000
    //500000/115200 = 4.34
    //4 and 5/16 = 4.3125
    //4.3125 * 16 * 115200 = 7948800

How you get from 4.34 to 4 5/16 is to subtract off the whole divisor 4
leaving 0.34 then multiply that by 16 and you get 5.444, that is closer
to 5 so our fraction is 5 (5/16ths).  You could also take 4.34 times
16 gives 69  69/16 = 4 5/16.  if you wanted to adjust that up or down
for accuracy you can try 68/16 or 79/16.  Doing it this way may help
you figure out how to adjust if close to a whole number boundary
some number x and 0/16.

So before we use the status register we blink the led about state change
a second and output a character.  do that a few times, then using the
TXE status bit blast a bunch of characters, hopefully they all make it,
then after that go into an echo loop, receive a character then
transmit it back.  What you type you get back.

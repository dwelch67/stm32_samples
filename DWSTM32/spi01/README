This example uses the spi interface with a Nokia 5110 display, these
are probably all recycled from old phones, who knows.  There seems
to be a large quantity of the out there.

Your board may have a row of pins above and below the display, they
are the same you only need one row.

The various examples out there use the same init routine.

    spi_command(0x21); //extended commands/horiz addressing/chip active
    spi_command(0xB0); //vop
    spi_command(0x04); //temp coef
    spi_command(0x14); //bias mode 1:48
    spi_command(0x20); //extended off/horizontal addressing, chip active
    spi_command(0x0C); //display on

So that set for horizontal addressing.  The display I bought on ebay
said 84x84 but it is really 84x48 pixels, obviously a typo or maybe
trying to sucker me in.  Doesnt matter wasnt holding my breath for a
bigger display.  First lets set the address pointer to the top left

    spi_command(0x80); //column left
    spi_command(0x40); //row    top

then if we just blast some bytes out start with a smaller number

    for(ra=0;ra<32;ra++) spi_data(ra);

you will see they swipe across the top left to right.  Each 8 bits
draws a column with those 8 bits with the lsbit being on the top, this
is also shown in the PCD8544 controller document that describes how
to program this thing.

and if you say write 100 bytes then after the 84th byte it
drops down and writes the next 8 rows of pixels and so on.
so 84*48 = 4032 pixels  4032 / 8 = 504 so if we write 504
bytes in theory we cover the screen.

    for(ra=0;ra<504;ra++) spi_data(ra);

and that does work.

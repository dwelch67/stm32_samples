There are two leds on this board that we can control, one is on PC8 the
other on PC9.

Some/many microcontrollers to save power require that you enable a logic
block in a part before using.  Before we can talk to gpio port c to
blink the leds on pins 8 and 9, we have to enable gpio port c.  This
happens in the RCC block.  Then we configure the two pins as output
push-pull (meaning we drive the pin both high and low) no pull up.

This example is in C with some asm to get things started.  Both gcc
and llvm's clang are used to create various flavors of binaries from
the same source.  The code is quite trivial but this hopefully creates
a foundation of how to use these tools for an environment like this.

The sram version of this code is meant to be loaded into sram and the
debugger told to start executing at the beginning, so it does not follow
the post-reset boot scheme of the cortex-m.

The flash version does have a vector table that allows this program
to boot from flash.

stm32f0 discovery examples

This repository is a collection of examples for use on the stm32f0
discovery board.

http://www.st.com/stm32f0-discovery

Then under products find the one that says STM32F0DISCO the STM32F0
one basically.

Currently that links to

http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM116/SC959/SS1532/LN1848/PF253215

Links below and document numbers may have changed from the time of this
writing.

Retails for $8.88 plus shipping.

Under the Design Resources tab you will find a schematic zip file which
as of this writing simply includes one pdf file.  From the schematics
the part number for the part we are using is STM32F051R8T6

go to the page that comes up for that part.

http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/product/251901.jsp

Under the Design Resources tab download the datasheet DS8668, note that
the document number is not part of the filename.  You will also
want the reference manual RM0091 and the programming manual PM0215.
For information on the serial bootloader add AN2606 and AN3155.

Go to the bottom of the datasheet, under part numbering.  The R means
64 pin, the 8 means 64Kbytes.  The T means LQFP.

For the uart examples we need to know the pins for tx and rx.  Searching
through the document you find that
PA9 is USART1_TX alternate function 1
PA10 is USART1_RX alternate function 1
PB6 is USART1_TX alternate function 0
PB7 is USART1_RX alternate function 0

This board uses a version 2 (V2) stlink interface, what that really
is there is another microcontroller on the board, that handles the
usb side of things, this one (STM32F103.. on the schematic) you do not
develop for.  It allows us to access the hardware debugger in the
stm32f0 part that we are here to program.  This includes loading and
running programs in ram and loading programs into flash to be run on
reset or power up.

No doubt there are closed source windows solutions, but I am interested
in open source linux solutions.  The main place to go for this is

https://github.com/texane/stlink

I am not a fan of gdb, but am a fan of jtag debugging there is support
for the stmf0 through openocd which is the popular open source jtag
utility for arm.  Note we are not directly manipulating the jtag on the
stm32f0 part, we are talking to the stlink microcontroller which is
manipulating the jtag on the stm32f0 for us.

Openocd home

http://openocd.sourceforge.net/

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
or
git clone git://repo.or.cz/openocd.git
or
git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/openocd.git

then

cd openocd
./boostrap
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --enable-stlink
or
../configure --enable-stlink --prefix=SOMEDIR
make
sudo make install

In various places in this document you will find an openocd config file
stm32f0discovery.cfg, this is derived from the stock openocd config.
The stock one simply points at two other files in openocd, instead I
pulled the three files and made one complete one that doesnt need to
go find anything else.  Personal preference no other reason.

To load a program in sram and run it the simplest way to do it is to
have one terminal for the openocd server.  Change to the directory
that contains your binary file (elf format), this way you dont have to
type in a path, then with openocd in your path

cd blinker01
openocd -f ../stm32f0discovery.cfg

it will connect and mention some breakpoints and such.

In another terminal, doesnt matter what directory it is in,

telnet localhost 4444

This should connect to the other and you should see both screens reflect
the connection.  IF THE CONNECTION WORKS then

> halt
> load_image blinker01.gcc.thumb.sram.elf
> resume 0x20000000

You can repeat those three lines over and over again as you continue
to develop your program (ideally in a third terminal).  The above
only writes the program to ram and runs it there.  When the power goes
out the program is lost.  To have the program run when power is applied
you need to write the program to the flash.  Building for flash
and for sram are two different binaries for reasons described elsewhere
(TODO).  Again using openocd and a terminal to log into the openocd
debug server (see above)

Looks like there is flash support now

> flash banks
#0 : stm32f0x.flash (stm32f1x) at 0x08000000, size 0x00010000, buswidth 0, chipwidth 0

The command is

flash write_image [erase] [unlock] filename [offset [file_type]]

> halt
> flash write_image erase blinker01.gcc.thumb.flash.elf
> reset

and the leds blink

> halt
> stm32f0x mass_erase 0
> reset

and they dont.

---------------------

These parts also include a serial bootloader, I have used this
bootloader before with another board.  The uloader directory contains
a framework of functions that you can use to program the part using the
built in serial bootloader.  See the README in the uloader directory

----------------

However you do things I highly recommend you keep in your toolbox one
or many usb to serial converters and you learn to use the uart for
debugging, bootloading, etc.  It remains a simpler to use interface
than usb.

A recent purchase, experimentally white is RX and green is TX, black GND

-----------------

Start with the blinker examples, sram builds.

My examples do not initialize .bss nor do I use .data.  To understand
how that affects you see the bssdata directory in my raspberry pi repo
http://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi  then go to the bssdata repo and
read the README.
